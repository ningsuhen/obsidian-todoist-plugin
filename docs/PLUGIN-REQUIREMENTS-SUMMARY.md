# Plugin Requirements Summary - Obsidian Todoist Plugin (ADHD-Optimized)

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive requirements for transforming the existing Obsidian Todoist plugin into an ADHD-optimized productivity system with painless, zero-configuration setup.

## Core Principle: Convention Over Configuration

**"The plugin should work perfectly with ZERO configuration beyond the API token."**

This principle eliminates cognitive overhead for ADHD users by:
- Removing decision fatigue from setup process
- Preventing analysis paralysis from too many options
- Providing immediate value without complexity
- Supporting executive function challenges
