# High-Level Design

## System Overview
The ADHD-optimized Obsidian Todoist plugin is a bidirectional synchronization system that seamlessly integrates Todoist task management with Obsidian's knowledge management capabilities. The system prioritizes zero-configuration setup, cognitive load reduction, and automatic knowledge context integration while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.

## Core Components

### Zero-Configuration Setup System
Handles the complete plugin initialization with only an API token, automatically creating folder structures, applying ADHD-optimized defaults, and migrating existing data without user intervention.

### Bidirectional Sync Engine
Manages real-time synchronization between Todoist and Obsidian, handling conflict resolution, offline support, and maintaining 99.9% reliability with <5 second latency targets.

### ADHD-Optimized UI Layer
Provides cognitive load reduction through minimal decision points, dopamine-friendly feedback systems, hyperfocus protection, and workflow preservation mechanisms.

### Knowledge Integration Engine
Automatically analyzes task content to create bidirectional links with relevant notes, learns user patterns, and provides context-aware suggestions for enhanced productivity.

### Convention-Based File Manager
Manages automatic file organization using human-readable names, project-based folder structures, and maintains full compatibility with Obsidian Tasks plugin format.

### Performance Optimization System
Ensures responsive UI, efficient memory usage, and optimal sync performance through intelligent caching, batch operations, and resource management.

## Data Flow
The system follows a event-driven architecture where changes in either Todoist or Obsidian trigger bidirectional synchronization while the Knowledge Engine continuously analyzes content for automatic linking opportunities.

    participant FM as File Manager
    participant KE as Knowledge Engine
    participant V as Vault
    participant UI as ADHD UI

    FM->>KE: Analyze Content
    KE->>V: Create Knowledge Links
    SE->>UI: Update Progress
    UI->>UI: Dopamine Feedback
    
    V->>FM: File Change Event
    FM->>SE: Sync to Todoist
    SE->>T: Update Task
    T->>SE: Confirmation
    SE->>UI: Success Feedback
```

## Component Interactions
Components communicate through a centralized event system that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data consistency. The ADHD UI layer intercepts all user interactions to apply cognitive load reduction patterns before delegating to appropriate systems.

## Technical Decisions

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Rationale:** Enables loose coupling between components while maintaining real-time responsiveness and supporting offline scenarios.
**Alternatives Considered:** Direct method calls, polling-based updates
**Trade-offs:** Slightly more complex debugging in exchange for better scalability and maintainability

### Convention-Over-Configuration Pattern
**Rationale:** Eliminates cognitive overhead for ADHD users by removing all configuration decisions while maintaining flexibility through intelligent defaults.
**Alternatives Considered:** Traditional configuration-heavy approach, wizard-based setup
**Trade-offs:** Less customization flexibility in exchange for dramatically improved user experience

### TypeScript with Strict Mode
**Rationale:** Provides type safety and better IDE support while maintaining compatibility with Obsidian's plugin ecosystem.
**Alternatives Considered:** JavaScript, other typed languages
**Trade-offs:** Slightly longer development time in exchange for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors

### React for UI Components
**Rationale:** Enables component reusability and state management while providing familiar development patterns for contributors.
**Alternatives Considered:** Vanilla JavaScript, Vue, Svelte
**Trade-offs:** Larger bundle size in exchange for better developer experience and component reusability
