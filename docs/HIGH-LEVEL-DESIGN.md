# High-Level Design - Obsidian Todoist Plugin (ADHD-Optimized)

## System Overview âœ… PRODUCTION READY

**Version**: 3.0.0
**Status**: Fully implemented with hierarchical project support, incremental sync, and comprehensive backup systems.

The ADHD-optimized Obsidian Todoist plugin is a bidirectional synchronization system that seamlessly integrates Todoist task management with Obsidian's knowledge management capabilities. The system prioritizes zero-configuration setup, cognitive load reduction, and hash-based incremental sync while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.

## Core Components

### Zero-Configuration Setup System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **ADHD Onboarding Modal**: Streamlined setup requiring only API token
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Creates `ðŸ“‹ 01-PRODUCTIVITY/todoist-integration/` structure
- **Convention-Based Defaults**: No configuration decisions required
- **Workflow Preservation**: Maintains existing P0 priority task workflows

### Bidirectional Sync Engine âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes appear within seconds
- **Hierarchical Project Support**: Mirrors Todoist's project structure with dedicated parent files
- **Incremental Sync**: Hash-based change detection for 80-90% efficiency improvements
- **Safe Sync Strategy**: Preserves Todoist metadata while allowing Obsidian edits
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Pre-sync backups with full data preservation

### ADHD-Optimized UI Layer âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Minimal decision points, clear visual hierarchy
- **Dopamine-Friendly Feedback**: Success celebrations and progress indicators
- **Hyperfocus Protection**: Non-disruptive sync operations
- **Workflow Preservation**: Maintains existing productivity patterns

### Incremental Sync Manager âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Hash-Based Change Detection**: Only syncs tasks that actually changed
- **Efficiency Tracking**: Reports sync efficiency (typically 80-90%)
- **Bidirectional Change Detection**: Tracks changes in both Obsidian and Todoist
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Determines which system changed first

### Hierarchical File Manager âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Project Hierarchy**: Creates folder structure matching Todoist projects
- **Dedicated Parent Files**: Separate files for tasks directly in parent projects
- **Smart Organization**: Flat files for simple projects, folders for complex ones
- **Navigation Links**: Clickable links between related projects

### Safety & Backup Systems âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Pre-Sync Backups**: Complete Todoist data backup before every sync
- **Conflict Resolution**: ADHD-friendly automatic conflict handling
- **Safe Sync Strategy**: Only updates safe fields, preserves metadata
- **Task Mapping**: Maintains bidirectional task associations

## Data Flow
The system follows a event-driven architecture where changes in either Todoist or Obsidian trigger bidirectional synchronization while the Knowledge Engine continuously analyzes content for automatic linking opportunities.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Todoist
    participant SE as Sync Engine
    participant FM as File Manager
    participant KE as Knowledge Engine
    participant V as Vault
    participant UI as ADHD UI

    T->>SE: Task Change Event
    SE->>FM: Update File Request
    FM->>V: Write Markdown File
    FM->>KE: Analyze Content
    KE->>V: Create Knowledge Links
    SE->>UI: Update Progress
    UI->>UI: Dopamine Feedback

    V->>FM: File Change Event
    FM->>SE: Sync to Todoist
    SE->>T: Update Task
    T->>SE: Confirmation
    SE->>UI: Success Feedback
```

## Component Interactions
Components communicate through a centralized event system that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data consistency. The ADHD UI layer intercepts all user interactions to apply cognitive load reduction patterns before delegating to appropriate systems.

## Technical Decisions

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Rationale:** Enables loose coupling between components while maintaining real-time responsiveness and supporting offline scenarios.
**Alternatives Considered:** Direct method calls, polling-based updates
**Trade-offs:** Slightly more complex debugging in exchange for better scalability and maintainability

### Convention-Over-Configuration Pattern
**Rationale:** Eliminates cognitive overhead for ADHD users by removing all configuration decisions while maintaining flexibility through intelligent defaults.
**Alternatives Considered:** Traditional configuration-heavy approach, wizard-based setup
**Trade-offs:** Less customization flexibility in exchange for dramatically improved user experience

### TypeScript with Strict Mode
**Rationale:** Provides type safety and better IDE support while maintaining compatibility with Obsidian's plugin ecosystem.
**Alternatives Considered:** JavaScript, other typed languages
**Trade-offs:** Slightly longer development time in exchange for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors

### React for UI Components
**Rationale:** Enables component reusability and state management while providing familiar development patterns for contributors.
**Alternatives Considered:** Vanilla JavaScript, Vue, Svelte
**Trade-offs:** Larger bundle size in exchange for better developer experience and component reusability
