## 🎯 **ADHD-Specific Success Criteria**

### **Performance Constraints**
- **Feedback Response Time**: <100ms (Critical for ADHD effectiveness)
- **Setup Time**: <120 seconds (Zero-configuration promise)
- **Cognitive Load**: <70% capacity (Measured via user testing)
- **Task Completion Rate**: >80% (ADHD user validation)

### **User Experience Validation**
- **50+ ADHD participants** in user testing program
- **Dopamine feedback effectiveness** >90% positive response
- **Setup completion rate** >98% (Zero-configuration validation)
- **Hyperfocus protection** validated through session monitoring

### **Technical Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: >85% with ADHD-specific scenarios
- **Code Quality**: >95% maintainability score
- **Documentation Alignment**: 100% doc-code synchronization
- **Performance**: All ADHD constraints met under load

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **ADHD User Testing**: Complex to recruit and validate
   - **Mitigation**: Partner with ADHD communities, provide incentives
   - **Fallback**: Simulate ADHD constraints through automated testing

2. **Performance Constraints**: <100ms feedback requirement
   - **Mitigation**: Performance-first development, continuous monitoring
   - **Fallback**: Graceful degradation with user notification

3. **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Complex technical challenge
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive automation testing, error handling
   - **Fallback**: Minimal configuration with smart defaults

### **Medium-Risk Areas**
1. **Community Adoption**: Plugin ecosystem competition
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on ADHD differentiation, community engagement
   - **Fallback**: Niche market focus with specialized features

2. **Todoist API Changes**: External dependency risk
   - **Mitigation**: API versioning, backward compatibility
   - **Fallback**: Local-only mode with manual sync
