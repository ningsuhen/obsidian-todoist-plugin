# Knowledge Engine - Design

## Overview

This document provides the design specifications for the Knowledge Engine, which automatically analyzes task content to create bidirectional links with relevant notes, learns user patterns, and provides context-aware suggestions. The engine achieves 80% automatic linking rate while supporting ADHD users through intelligent context discovery and minimal cognitive overhead.

## Data Flow

### Automatic Linking Flow

```mermaid

    participant T as Task
    participant CA as ContentAnalyzer
    participant CSE as ContextSuggestionEngine
    participant KL as KnowledgeLinker
    participant V as Vault
    participant PL as PatternLearner
    participant UI as ADHD UI
    
    T->>CA: New Task Content
    CA->>CA: Extract Keywords & Entities
    CA->>CSE: Analysis Results
    
    CSE->>V: Search Relevant Notes
    V->>CSE: Matching Notes
    
    CSE->>PL: Get User Patterns
    PL->>CSE: Pattern Data
    
    CSE->>CSE: Score Relevance
    CSE->>KL: Top Suggestions
    
    KL->>V: Create Bidirectional Links
    KL->>UI: Link Creation Feedback
    
    UI->>PL: User Interaction
    PL->>PL: Update Patterns
```

The knowledge engine processes task content in real-time, analyzing semantic meaning and automatically creating relevant links while learning from user behavior to improve accuracy.

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

1. **Analysis Failures**
   - NLP service unavailable, malformed content, language detection issues
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Fallback to keyword-based analysis, graceful degradation

2. **Link Creation Errors**
   - File access issues, circular references, invalid note IDs
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Retry with validation, user notification, link queue

3. **Pattern Learning Failures**
   - Insufficient data, model corruption, storage issues
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Reset to defaults, rebuild patterns, backup restoration

4. **Performance Degradation**
   - High CPU usage, memory leaks, slow response times
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Throttling, background processing, resource optimization

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

- **Graceful Fallback**: Use simpler algorithms when advanced features fail
- **Background Recovery**: Retry failed operations during idle periods
- **User Transparency**: Clear feedback about analysis status and limitations
- **Data Protection**: Ensure no data loss during error scenarios

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **analysisDepth**: 'detailed' - Balance between accuracy and performance
- **autoLinkThreshold**: 0.7 - Confidence threshold for automatic linking
- **maxSuggestions**: 5 - ADHD-optimized to prevent decision paralysis
- **learningEnabled**: true - Continuous improvement through user feedback

### Environment Variables
- `KNOWLEDGE_ENGINE_MODE`: 'local' | 'cloud' for processing location
- `NLP_SERVICE_URL`: External NLP service endpoint if using cloud processing
- `PATTERN_STORAGE_PATH`: Location for storing learned patterns

### Configuration Schema

```typescript
interface KnowledgeEngineConfig {
  analysis: {
    depth: 'basic' | 'detailed' | 'comprehensive';
    languageModel: string;
    enableEntityExtraction: boolean;
    enableSentimentAnalysis: boolean;
  };
  linking: {
    autoLinkThreshold: number;
    maxAutoLinks: number;
    bidirectionalLinks: boolean;
    linkStrengthDecay: number;
  };
  suggestions: {
    maxSuggestions: number;
    suggestionTimeout: number;
    enableRealTimeSuggestions: boolean;
  };
  learning: {
    enablePatternLearning: boolean;
    learningRate: number;
    patternRetentionDays: number;
  };
}
```

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Content analysis: < 2 seconds for typical task content
- Link suggestions: < 1 second for real-time suggestions

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All content analysis happens locally when possible
- No task content sent to external services without explicit consent
- Pattern data anonymized and encrypted

### Content Security
- Sanitize all text input to prevent injection attacks
- Validate note IDs and file paths before access
- Secure storage of learned patterns and user preferences

## Testing Strategy

- User behavior simulation for pattern learning validation
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Performance Tests

- Memory usage during extended operations
- Suggestion accuracy measurement over time

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js or similar for pattern learning

### Internal Module Connections
- **Sync Engine**: Triggers analysis when tasks are created or updated
- **File Management**: Accesses vault content for note analysis
- **ADHD UI System**: Displays suggestions and link feedback

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: Analysis failures, link creation errors, pattern corruption
- **WARN**: Low confidence suggestions, performance degradation
- **INFO**: Successful link creation, pattern learning updates
- **DEBUG**: Detailed analysis results, suggestion scoring

### Metrics
