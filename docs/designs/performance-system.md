The performance system continuously monitors and optimizes all operations to maintain ADHD-friendly responsiveness while efficiently managing system resources.

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

1. **Performance Degradation**
   - High latency, memory leaks, CPU spikes, unresponsive UI
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Automatic optimization, resource cleanup, operation throttling

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Out of memory, disk space, network bandwidth limits
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Aggressive cleanup, cache eviction, operation deferral

3. **Cache Failures**
   - Cache corruption, storage errors, invalidation failures
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Cache rebuild, fallback to direct operations, data recovery

4. **Optimization Failures**
   - Optimization algorithms fail, performance regression, system instability
   - **Recovery Strategy**: Rollback optimizations, safe mode operation, manual intervention

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when performance features fail
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing mechanisms for common performance issues
- **Resource Protection**: Prevent system exhaustion through proactive management
- **User Transparency**: Clear feedback about performance status without overwhelming users

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **memoryLimit**: 100MB - Maximum memory usage for optimal performance
- **cacheSize**: 50MB - Balance between performance and memory usage
- **syncLatencyTarget**: 5000ms - Maximum acceptable sync latency

### Environment Variables
- `PERF_MONITORING_ENABLED`: Enable/disable performance monitoring
- `PERF_CACHE_SIZE`: Override default cache size limit

  };
  caching: {
    maxCacheSize: number;
    defaultTTL: number;
    evictionStrategy: 'lru' | 'lfu' | 'ttl';
    preloadStrategies: string[];
  };
  optimization: {
    enableAutomaticOptimization: boolean;
    optimizationInterval: number;
    resourceThresholds: ResourceThresholds;
  };
  latency: {
    targetResponseTime: number;
